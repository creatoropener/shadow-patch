# Changelog

## v0.5.5 — consolidated submission release, 2026-09-20

- Bring the demonstrated issue-to-PR engine into creatoropener/shadow-patch.
- Include runtime adapters, all required helpers, and the standalone TypeScript loader.
- Preserve existing tests as solver context while withholding the generated regression.
- Retry invalid proposals with validation feedback; omit redundant unchanged edits
  but reject proposals without a net source change.
- Allow one baseline correction per candidate without hidden-regression feedback.
- Preserve three candidate evaluations, protected regression checks and clean replay.
- Include the corrected PR notification and Python bytecode prevention/ignore rules.
- Add setup, architecture, evidence, screenshots, demo and submission materials.
- Move the previous v0.2 implementation and documentation intact to `legacy/v0.2/`.

This consolidation does not claim a new live run. The attached v0.5.5 report and
linked GitHub runs document the earlier demonstrated target execution.

Earlier prototype history: [legacy changelog](legacy/v0.2/CHANGELOG.md).
