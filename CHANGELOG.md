# Changelog

## v0.6.0-rc.1 — TypeScript runtime hardening, 2026-09-21

- Add an explicit `node-typescript` adapter using pinned `tsx` and normal project imports.
- Add the `CONTREE_IMAGE_NODE_TYPESCRIPT` workflow secret and v0.6 web image tag.
- Check image capabilities and the existing baseline before requesting verifier inference.
- Report configuration, runtime, repository-analysis and baseline failures as
  `BLOCKED` rather than incorrectly describing them as rejected repairs.
- Add engine-owned Web Streams byte-source/collection helpers and reject generated
  stream tests that bypass the deterministic plumbing.
- Auto-detect package roots with `tsconfig.json` as `node-typescript`.
- Add runtime contract CI and expose the failure stage in rejected reports.
- Retire the custom standalone TypeScript source loader from current installations.

This is a release candidate. The historical v0.5.5 green run remains the recorded
verification evidence until the file-sharing Issue #3 acceptance run completes.

## v0.5.5 — consolidated submission release, 2026-09-20

- Bring the demonstrated issue-to-PR engine into creatoropener/shadow-patch.
- Include runtime adapters, all required helpers, and the standalone TypeScript loader.
- Preserve existing tests as solver context while withholding the generated regression.
- Retry invalid proposals with validation feedback; omit redundant unchanged edits
  but reject proposals without a net source change.
- Allow one baseline correction per candidate without hidden-regression feedback.
- Preserve three candidate evaluations, protected regression checks and clean replay.
- Include the corrected PR notification and Python bytecode prevention/ignore rules.
- Add setup, architecture, evidence, screenshots, demo and submission materials.
- Move the previous v0.2 implementation and documentation intact to `legacy/v0.2/`.

This consolidation does not claim a new live run. The attached v0.5.5 report and
linked GitHub runs document the earlier demonstrated target execution.

Earlier prototype history: [legacy changelog](legacy/v0.2/CHANGELOG.md).
